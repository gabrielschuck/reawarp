Audio warping for REAPER, in the spirit of Ableton Live's Warp: reawarp detects the beats
of a song (including songs whose tempo drifts or changes) and then

- **Warp**: fits the item to the project tempo (a stretch marker on each beat),
- **Tempo map**: makes the project follow the song (a tempo marker on each beat), or
- **Groove Match**: makes other items (a loop, another recording) follow the beats of a
  reference item, without touching the project tempo, or
- **Quantize**: moves the attacks of the audio onto the notes of a MIDI item, which gives
  the rhythm (straight, swing, a shuffle such as the tarantella).

Wrong beats can be fixed from the keyboard: move to the next or previous beat marker (OSARA
announces bar, beat and BPM; without OSARA they are shown in a note near the mouse), and
move, add or delete a marker; the warp, tempo map or groove match is applied again by itself.

Several items can be processed together, for example a song and a loop in a remix, or the
tracks of a multitrack recording; see [Several items at once](#several-items-at-once).

Written in Lua; beats are detected by the neural detector
[Beat This!](https://github.com/CPJKU/beat_this), installed with one click (no Python
installation needed). The whole interface uses REAPER's native menus and dialogs, so it works with
screen readers (OSARA). Without OSARA everything is visual too: results appear in a dialog,
a running action shows its progress in a tooltip near the mouse, and moving between beat
markers shows the marker in a note near the mouse that goes away by itself. Messages are in
English, Portuguese or Spanish, as set in the *Language* setting.

## Installation

**With ReaPack** (recommended: updates arrive by themselves):

1. In REAPER: *Extensions > ReaPack > Import repositories...* and paste
   `https://github.com/gabrielschuck/reawarp/raw/main/index.xml`
2. *Extensions > ReaPack > Browse packages*, search for **reawarp** and install it.
   All the actions appear in the Action List.

**Manually** (without ReaPack):

1. Download the ZIP of the latest version from
   [Releases](https://github.com/gabrielschuck/reawarp/releases) and extract the `reawarp`
   folder into REAPER's `Scripts` folder (*Options > Show REAPER resource path*).
2. In REAPER: *Actions > Show action list > New action > Load ReaScript...* and load
   `reawarp.lua`.
3. Run the `reawarp.lua` action once. It opens the menu and registers the individual
   actions in the Action List (you can cancel the menu afterwards).

Then install the Beat This! detector from the reawarp menu (see below). Optional: assign
shortcuts to the actions.

All the code is in `reawarp.lua`. REAPER maps each action to one file, so the individual
actions are two-line files in the `actions/` subfolder; they only call the matching
function in `reawarp.lua`. You never need to edit them, and they are recreated if deleted.

Moving from a manual installation to ReaPack: ReaPack installs into
`Scripts/reawarp/Tempo/`. To keep the Beat This! already installed, move the folders
`env`, `models`, `python` and `uv` from the old `backend` folder into the new one, then
delete the old `Scripts/reawarp/reawarp.lua` and `actions` (and remove their entries from
the Action List). Moving the folders breaks the Python environment's links, so then run
*Install the Beat This! detector...* from the reawarp menu once: it repairs the
environment in a few seconds and reuses what is already downloaded.

REAPER keeps responding while an action works: Beat This! runs in the background and the
analysis gives REAPER its window back many times a second, so you can keep moving around
the project (do not edit the item being analyzed). The result is announced through OSARA;
without OSARA it is shown in a window (moving between beat markers shows the marker in a
note near the mouse instead, since a window after every key press would get in the way).
Dialogs only appear when reawarp needs an answer
(time signature, removing a tempo map, a new BPM) and for the settings. Running the same
action again while it works cancels it (Undo reverts what it had already changed); starting
another reawarp action meanwhile only announces that it is still working. When an action starts,
OSARA announces that reawarp is processing; the analysis report is still shown in a
dialog, since it explains what to check next.

### Beat This! detector (required)

[Beat This!](https://github.com/CPJKU/beat_this) (CPJKU, ISMIR 2024) is a neural beat and
downbeat tracker. reawarp needs it: the first analysis without it asks to install it.

reawarp also has a built-in detector (pure Lua), but it is not reliable enough to be the
default. Benchmarked against Beat This! on 47 songs of many genres, it agreed on about 75%
of them; it fails where the strongest attacks are off the beat (reggae, samba, hip-hop, rock
with offbeat guitar) and where there is no clear kick/snare (ballads). About 25 variants of
its onset sensitivity, band weighting and tracking did not change that. It is still
available for those who cannot install Beat This!: choose `builtin` as the *Beat detector* in
the settings. If Beat This! is installed but fails, reawarp stops with
an error instead of silently using the built-in detector; running the installer again
repairs it.

- Requirements: an internet connection during the installation. No Python installation
  is needed: the installer downloads [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), which brings
  its own private Python, never touching a Python already on the computer.
- Install: in the reawarp menu choose *Install the Beat This! detector*, or run
  `backend/install_beat_this.bat` (Windows) or `backend/install_beat_this.sh` (macOS /
  Linux). It downloads about 350 MB and uses about 800 MB of disk, all inside `backend/`
  (`uv`, `python`, `env` and `models`). To uninstall, choose *Uninstall the Beat This! detector* in the
  reawarp menu (once Beat This! is installed, it takes the place of *Install the Beat This! detector*): it deletes those four folders and
  frees about 0.8 GB (3 GB for the GPU version); reawarp itself stays installed.
  The installer window closes by itself at the end, and reawarp shows the result in a
  dialog; if it fails, the dialog shows the end of the report and offers to copy the
  whole report (`backend/install.log`) to the clipboard.
  On macOS / Linux the installer leaves nothing writable by everyone (folders 775,
  files 664), so REAPER's folder can be synced to the cloud (MEGA and others refuse
  777); if an older install left 777 folders, run the installer again. Temporary files
  of the analysis go to `/tmp`, not to REAPER's folder.
- Analysis takes about 5 to 8 seconds per song instead of about 1.
- With an NVIDIA graphics card (Windows, Linux), the installer asks whether to install
  the GPU version: Beat This! runs about twice as fast (a 4-minute song: about 3 s
  instead of 6 s), but it downloads about 2.5 GB and uses about 3 GB of disk. It picks
  the CUDA version that the card's driver supports; if the GPU fails, reawarp uses the
  CPU. On a Mac with Apple silicon the standard version already uses the GPU. To switch
  between the versions, run the installer again and answer the question differently.
- Copy the `backend` folder next to `reawarp.lua` for this to work.

The warp does not pick a stretch algorithm: it uses the time stretch / pitch shift mode and
the stretch marker mode set on the item (item properties) or, when the item uses the
default, on the project (*Project settings*).

## Workflow

1. Select the item and run **Analyze beats**. Take markers `RW bar.beat` are created (red
   on beat 1). The report shows the BPM, its range, the detected time signature (3/4 or
   4/4) and the first downbeat. The warp aligns that downbeat with the bar line nearest to
   where the item is; to pick another bar, move the item close to it before warping.
2. Check the result. If needed:
   - **Half or double BPM** → run **Double BPM** or **Halve BPM**. They change the BPM of
     what follows: after a *Tempo map*, the project tempo (the song is untouched); after a
     *Warp*, the song's speed (the project tempo is untouched; e.g. a song detected at half
     tempo plays twice too fast, and *Halve BPM* brings it back). Beat 1 stays in place,
     and the tempo map or warp is applied again.
     Doubling uses the beats the detector actually found between the existing ones when
     it has them (Beat This!, or beats removed by *Halve BPM*), else the midpoints. You
     can also set *Approximate BPM* in the settings and analyze again.
   - **Wrong time signature** → set it in the settings (`3/4`, `4/4`, `6/8`, `12/8`...)
     and analyze again. Compound meters (6/8, 9/8, 12/8) count the dotted quarter as the
     beat; use them when the analysis reports a BPM 1.5× lower than expected.
   - **Wrong beat 1** → place the edit cursor on the correct beat 1 and run *Set downbeat
     at edit cursor*.
   - **A wrong beat** → go to it with *Next beat marker* / *Previous beat marker* (OSARA
     announces the marker, for example "RW 3.2 (beat 10 of 120, 98.5 BPM)"), then place
     the edit cursor where the beat really is and run *Move nearest beat marker to edit
     cursor*; *Add beat marker at edit cursor* fills a beat the detector missed, and
     *Delete nearest beat marker* removes an extra one. If the item already has a warp,
     tempo map or groove match, it is applied again by itself. You can also move or
     delete the `RW` markers by hand. The markers are the grid the warp uses; reawarp
     does not recreate them if they exist.
   - **A stretch of beats early or late by the same amount** → select it with a time
     selection and run *Move beat markers left by grid* / *right by grid* (one division
     of the project grid, for example 1/32, each time), or *Move nearest beat marker to
     edit cursor*: every marker in the selection moves by the same amount, keeping the
     intervals between them (by Gianluca Apollaro). For a stretch on the off-beats (half
     a beat off) use *Shift beats by half a beat* below instead, which also puts back a
     beat missing at the edge.
   - **Part of the song on the off-beats** → in an intro with only a voice, or a break,
     the detector may mark the off-beats; where the band comes in, it goes back to the
     beats, and there the gap between two beat markers is 1.5 beats (or 0.5). Place the
     edit cursor there (up to 3 beats away is fine) and run *Shift beats by half a beat*: the beats before the cursor
     move half a beat, and the warp, tempo map or groove match is applied again. For a
     stretch in the middle of the song, select it with a time selection first. The
     direction is the one that turns the jump into a whole beat; if there is no such jump
     at the edges, nothing is changed.
3. Run **Warp** or **Tempo map**.
   - *Warp*: the song's downbeat goes to the bar line nearest to where it already is, and
     every beat (or every N beats) gets a stretch marker on the grid. The song then plays
     at the project BPM; to keep its original tempo, use *Tempo map*.
     If the item was never analyzed, it is analyzed first without showing a report.
     If the project has a varying tempo map where the item is (e.g. left over from a
     *Tempo map*), reawarp asks whether to remove it and use a fixed tempo; otherwise the
     warped song would follow that varying tempo.
     When everything works the warp opens no window (with OSARA it announces "Warp
     applied"); a dialog only appears to ask about the time signature or the tempo map.
     2/4, 4/4 and 2/2 are treated as equivalent (they cannot be told apart reliably from
     audio, and their bar lines coincide): a duple-meter song uses the project's signature.
     If the song's signature differs from the project's (e.g. 3/4 in a 4/4 project),
     reawarp asks whether to insert the song's signature at the start of the item (and
     restore the previous one after it) so that the bars match. The item keeps its time
     stretch and stretch marker modes and, by default, switches to the "beats (position,
     length, rate)" timebase so it stays in sync if the project tempo changes later.
     With several items selected, each one is warped by its own beats (see
     [Several items at once](#several-items-at-once)). When the item
     starts right on its first beat (a loop), its first few milliseconds play at their own
     speed, because REAPER's stretching smears an attack at the very start of an item;
     the stretch begins just after that attack.
   - *Tempo map*: the project tempo follows the song from before the music starts, so the
     intro, pickup beats and count-in are already at the song's tempo: from the project
     start when no tempo marker comes before the item, otherwise from the bar line where
     the item starts (earlier markers, e.g. of another song, are kept). The item is moved
     (by less than half a bar) so its downbeat falls on a bar line, and every beat,
     pickups included, gets a tempo marker. Afterwards the item follows later tempo
     changes like a warped item ("beats (position, length, rate)" timebase), or keeps its
     own timebase if *Item follows tempo changes* is 0. Existing tempo markers in the
     item's range are replaced. With several items selected, the first one (in track
     order) makes the tempo map and the others are warped to it, as with *Warp* (see
     [Several items at once](#several-items-at-once)).
   - *Groove Match*: select the reference item (for example a song or drums) and the
     items that should follow it (for example a loop). The reference is the first selected
     item in track order, so put it on the upper track. Each of the other items gets
     stretch markers so that its beats follow the reference's beats, including its
     accelerations and slowdowns, while it stays where you placed it; the reference and
     the project tempo are not changed. Beats are matched to the nearest beats of the
     reference, not bar to bar, so place the item near the beat where it should start.
     *Double BPM* and *Halve BPM* also work on matched items.

### Several items at once

Select the items and run the action. They are taken in track order: the item on the upper
track (the first track in the project, when they are on different tracks) is the
**reference**, as in *Groove Match* and in *Sync other items* (below). MIDI items are ignored.

- **Warp**: there is no reference item, the reference is the project tempo. Each item is
  analyzed and warped by its own beats onto the project grid, so a song and a loop recorded
  at different tempos both end up at the project BPM, in time with each other.
- **Tempo map**: the reference item makes the tempo map, and every other selected item is
  warped onto that map, so it takes the tempo of the reference, with its accelerations and
  slowdowns. Example: in a remix, put the song on the upper track and a loop (drums, a
  bass line) on a track below, place the loop near the bar where it should start, select
  both and run *Tempo map*: the project tempo follows the song, and the loop follows it
  bar by bar.
- **Groove Match**: the reference item and the project tempo are not changed; the other
  items follow the beats of the reference.
- **Fixed project tempo from item** uses only the first selected item.

**Song and loop: Tempo map or Groove Match?** In both, the loop ends up following the song's
tempo, beat by beat. The difference is the project grid:

- With *Tempo map*, the project tempo (metronome, grid, MIDI, new recordings) follows the
  song too, so anything added later is in time with the song and the loop. This is the
  usual choice for a remix or for adding instruments to a recording.
- With *Groove Match*, only the loop follows the song; the project tempo stays as it was.
  Use it when the project already has a tempo that must not change (for example other
  songs in the same project), and the loop just has to lock to the song.
- With *Warp* (selecting both), it is the other way round: the song is stretched to the
  fixed project tempo, and the loop too.

With *Stretch marker every N beats* set to 0 (automatic), each item gets markers only
where its tempo moves away from the reference (the project grid, or the tempo map made by
the reference item), within the *Auto markers* tolerance.

Multitrack recordings: with *Sync other items* set to 1 in the settings, a warp or tempo
map applied to one item (for example the drums) is applied in the same way to the items
grouped with it (select them and press Ctrl+G, *Group items*), so the whole band stays together; 2 includes every
unlocked audio item that overlaps it, leaving MIDI items out (so a MIDI part or a quantize
reference stays on the project grid); 3 includes every unlocked item, MIDI too. By default (0) only the selected items are changed.

For a loop, or a song with a steady tempo, **Fixed project tempo from item** sets the project to
the item's BPM as one fixed tempo, without a tempo map: the item keeps its own speed and is
moved (by less than half a bar) so its downbeat falls on a bar line. The BPM comes from all
the beats together (for a loop, from its length, which is a whole number of beats), and it
is rounded when it is within 0.02 of a whole number. If the project has tempo markers where
the item is, reawarp asks before removing them; if the item's tempo varies, the result
says so (a song with a varying tempo is better followed by *Tempo map* or *Warp*).

To make a song with a tempo map faster or slower, use **Change song tempo**: REAPER's
project BPM only changes the tempo up to the next tempo marker (one per beat here), so this
action asks for a new average BPM and scales every marker of the song by the same factor,
keeping each on its bar and beat. With an item selected it changes that item's range;
with none, the whole project. The item follows with its pitch preserved. Other items in that
range that reawarp warped (a loop, for example) are warped again onto the new tempo, so the
start of a loop keeps its attack.

### Quantize to a MIDI item

**Quantize to MIDI item** moves the attacks of audio items onto the notes of a MIDI item,
which gives the rhythm: draw or record the figure you want (straight eighths, a swing, a
shuffle such as the tarantella, or the groove of another performance), on a track above.

1. Make the audio follow the project tempo first, with *Warp* or *Tempo map* (the quantize
   works on the beats being in time with the grid).
2. Select the MIDI item (the reference, on the upper track) and one or more audio items.
3. Run **Quantize to MIDI item**.

Each note stands for a position of the straight grid, the most common number of notes per
beat in the MIDI item: with two notes per beat it is eighths, so a note at 2/3 of the beat
(a triplet swing) takes the audio of the half beat, and a note on the beat takes the audio
of the beat. The audio there is pinned on the note with a stretch marker, on its attack
when there is one near; the audio in between (sixteenths, for example) is stretched along.
Only where the notes start matters, not how long they are. Muted notes are ignored; a looped
MIDI item counts only its first pass. Outside the notes, the item stays as it was (its
warp, for example). Several audio items can be quantized at once, and the same MIDI item
can be used for other songs: with *Sync other items* at 2, a warp leaves MIDI items alone.

**Quantize settings** (in the menu, or the action *Quantize settings*):

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Strength in % | 75 | 100 puts each attack exactly on its note; 50 moves it half the way, keeping part of the original feel and stretching less |
| Look for the attack within N ms of the grid | 25 | How far from the straight grid position the attack of the audio is looked for. 0 uses the grid position itself |
| Sensitivity in % | 50 | 100 accepts even the softest attacks (in a dense mix), 0 only very clear ones. Where no attack is accepted, the grid position itself is used |

The defaults are on the safe side: the groove is clearly felt, with fewer stretching
artifacts. For an exact, aggressive quantize (the audio follows the MIDI note for note),
use strength 100, 40 ms and sensitivity 100.

Each action is a single undo step (Ctrl+Z).

## Settings

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum / maximum BPM | 60 / 180 | Tempo search range |
| Approximate BPM | 0 | If > 0, searches near this value (fixes half/double tempo) |
| Time signature | auto | `auto` detects 3/4 or 4/4; or type `3/4`, `6/8`, `5/4`... |
| Tempo flexibility | 50 | 0 = rigid tempo (electronic); 100 = very loose (live, rubato) |
| Stretch marker every N beats | 1 | Use 4 (one per bar) for fewer artifacts. 0 = automatic: markers only where the tempo changes (between two markers the audio is stretched evenly; a beat gets a marker only when, without it, a beat would be more than the tolerance away from the grid). A steady song gets few markers, a rubato one many. Also used for the tempo markers of *Tempo map* |
| Auto markers: tolerance in ms | 10 | With N = 0: how far (in ms) a beat may land from the grid before it gets a marker |
| Smooth grid | 0 | -1 = fit one constant tempo; N = smooth over ±N beats |
| Snap to transients | 1 | Moves each beat to the start of the nearest attack (±30 ms) |
| Fine snap | 0 | With Beat This!, 1 puts each beat on its own first attack (within 12 ms) instead of only correcting the average offset; try it when some beats sound a little late in dense passages |
| Item follows tempo changes | 1 | Item timebase after the warp |
| Change project time sig | 1 | On warp, if the signatures differ: 0 = never, 1 = ask, 2 = always |
| Sync other items | 0 | On warp/tempo map: 0 = no, 1 = items grouped with the selected item, 2 = all overlapping unlocked audio items, 3 = all overlapping unlocked items including MIDI |
| Beat detector | auto | `auto` (or `beat_this`) uses Beat This!; `builtin` uses the less reliable built-in detector |
| Visual progress and results | auto | A tooltip near the mouse shows the stage and the time elapsed while an action runs. `auto` shows it only without OSARA (screen readers may read every update); `on` or `off`. With OSARA and `on`, the result of each action is also shown in the tooltip for a few seconds, besides being spoken: useful to show reawarp to people who watch, in a video or a class |
| Language | auto | `auto`, `en`, `pt-BR` or `es`. `auto` uses REAPER's language pack, or else the system language |

## Translations

All messages are in the `STRINGS` table near the top of section 2 of `reawarp.lua`.
English (`STRINGS.en`) is the reference. To add a language, copy that table under a new
code (for example `STRINGS["fr"]`), translate the values (keep every `%s`, `%d`, `%.2f`...
in the same order) and, for automatic detection, add the language to `detect_lang`. Users
can also pick it by typing its code in the *Language* setting. Keys missing from a
translation fall back to English. Setting
captions must not contain commas (REAPER's input dialog uses them as separators).

## How it works

The first section of `reawarp.lua` (independent of REAPER):

1. Audio is mixed to mono (all of its channels, so multichannel items work too), read
   at 11025 Hz and split into 4 bands (low, low-mid, mid, high). The flux
   of log energy between 11.6 ms frames gives the onset strength curve.
2. Global tempo by autocorrelation, with a preference around 120 BPM (or your hint).
3. Local tempo curve (8 s windows) that follows accelerandos and drifts.
4. Beat tracking by dynamic programming (Ellis, 2007) using the local period.
5. Each beat is snapped to the start of the nearest transient, with ~1 ms precision.
6. Time signature: per-band rhythm patterns at each beat repeat every bar; correlation at
   lags of 3/9 and 4/8 beats is compared.
7. The downbeat is estimated from bass accents (kick), in log and linear scale (to tell
   the strong kick on beat 1 from the softer one on beat 3).

With Beat This! installed, `backend/reawarp_beat_this.py` replaces steps 2 to 7: it returns
beats and downbeats, refined below the model's 20 ms frames by interpolating the peak of
its output. reawarp then picks the metrical level closest to its own tempo estimate,
thins or fills stretches where the detector briefly switches to eighth notes or skips
beats (using the local tempo curve of step 3 as reference), and takes the time signature
and bar phase from the downbeats.

## Tests

```
pip install lupa numpy
python tests/test_dsp.py            # synthetic signals: steady, ramp, drift, 3/4
python tests/test_dsp.py song.mp3   # analyzes a file (needs ffmpeg on the PATH)
python tests/test_core.py           # full actions against a simulated REAPER
```

`tests/reaper_run.lua` runs the actions in real REAPER, in a separate project tab, and
re-analyzes the processed audio to measure how far the beats land from the grid. It is
called by a short script that sets `RW_MAIN`, `RW_OUT`, `RW_RPP` and `RW_CASES` (see the
file header) and is sent to the running instance with `reaper.exe -nonewinst script.lua`.

## Known limitations

- Downbeat detection is a heuristic (kick drum); use *Set downbeat at edit cursor* when it
  is wrong.
- Intros without a clear pulse (rubato, a single instrument, a long pickup) may get their
  first beats misplaced, mostly with the built-in detector. Check the first `RW` markers
  and move or delete the wrong ones before warping.
- Time signature changes within a song are not detected.
- Automatic detection tells duple (2/4, 4/4) from triple (3/4) meter; compound or
  irregular meters (6/8, 5/4, 7/8) must be set in the settings.

## Contributing

reawarp for REAPER aims to be a warp as good as it seems. If it is helping your project in
any way, please consider contributing:

- **Bug reports and suggestions**: open an
  [issue](https://github.com/gabrielschuck/reawarp/issues). For a song that is detected
  or warped wrongly, say which action you ran, the settings, what you expected and what
